## Technical Implementation Details

### Race Format Detection Logic

```go
// Auto-detection based on race characteristics
if raceData.TotalLaps > 0 {
    if raceData.TotalLaps <= 15 { return "sprint" }
    if raceData.TotalLaps >= 60 { return "endurance" }
    return "standard"
} else {
    if totalSessionTime <= 30*60 { return "sprint" }
    if totalSessionTime >= 120*60 { return "endurance" }
    return "standard"
}
```

### Prompt Specialization Examples

#### Sprint Race Context

- **System Role**: "Sprint races are short, intense battles where every position matters and there's little room for error."
- **Strategic Priorities**: "Aggressive positioning, minimal pit stops, track position is CRITICAL"
- **Decision Criteria**: "Can we gain positions through strategy vs on-track overtaking?"

#### Endurance Race Context

- **System Role**: "Endurance races are marathon events where consistency, tire management, and strategic patience win races."
- **Strategic Priorities**: "Long-term tire and fuel management for optimal stint lengths"
- **Decision Criteria**: "What are the optimal stint lengths for tire compounds?"

### Enhanced Analysis Output

```json
{
	"race_format": "sprint",
	"current_situation": "Sprint race P4 at Monza - aggressive positioning phase",
	"primary_strategy": "Maintain track position, push for overtakes in DRS zones",
	"strategic_timeline": "Next 3 laps: Attack phase, Laps 4-7: Consolidate position",
	"immediate_actions": ["Attack in sector 2", "Defend into Turn 1"]
}
```
