# Task 1.7 Completion Summary: Data Validation and Error Handling for Connection Failures

## Overview

Task 1.7 has been **successfully completed** with a comprehensive implementation of data validation and error handling for connection failures across all simulator connectors (ACC, iRacing, and LMU).

## Components Implemented

### 1. Data Validation System (`validation.go`)

- **DataValidator** struct with configurable validation parameters
- **ValidationConfig** with sensible defaults for all telemetry data types:
  - Speed limits (0-500 km/h)
  - RPM limits (0-15,000)
  - Fuel data validation (0-200L capacity, usage rates, percentages)
  - Temperature ranges (tires: 0-150°C, air: -20-60°C)
  - Tire pressure validation (10-50 PSI)
  - Lap time validation (30 seconds - 15 minutes)
  - Position validation (1-100)
  - Percentage validation (0-100%)
  - Track length validation (0.5-25km)
  - Enum validations for simulator types, session types, flags, etc.

### 2. Error Handling Framework (`connection_handler.go`)

- **ConnectionError** type for structured error reporting
- **RetryHandler** with exponential backoff and configurable retry policies
- **CircuitBreaker** implementation following the circuit breaker pattern
- **ConnectionHealthMonitor** for centralized connection management

### 3. Connection Retry Logic

- Exponential backoff with jitter support
- Configurable retry attempts (default: 5)
- Retryable error detection based on error patterns
- Context-aware cancellation support

### 4. Circuit Breaker Pattern

- Three states: Closed, Open, Half-Open
- Configurable failure threshold (default: 5 failures)
- Automatic recovery after timeout (default: 30 seconds)
- Half-open testing with limited calls

### 5. Health Monitoring System

- Continuous health checking for all registered connectors
- Detailed metrics including circuit breaker states
- Automatic fallback to last known good data during failures
- Centralized status reporting

### 6. Data Sanitization

- Automatic correction of invalid values
- Value clamping within valid ranges
- NaN/Infinity handling
- Graceful degradation for partially invalid data

## Integration with Existing Connectors

### ACC Connector Enhancements

- Integrated validation and retry logic
- Circuit breaker protection for shared memory operations
- Fallback to last valid data during connection issues
- Enhanced error reporting with connection-specific details

### iRacing Connector Enhancements

- Added validation for iRacing SDK data
- Retry logic for SDK connection failures
- Health monitoring for simulator availability
- Robust error handling for network operations

### LMU Connector Enhancements

- Prepared validation framework for future LMU implementation
- Consistent error handling patterns
- Ready for rFactor 2 SDK integration

## Testing Coverage

### Validation Tests (`validation_test.go`)

- Comprehensive test suite for all validation methods
- Edge case testing (NaN, Infinity, boundary values)
- Data sanitization verification
- Error message validation

### Connection Handler Tests (`connection_handler_test.go`)

- Circuit breaker state transition testing
- Retry logic with various failure scenarios
- Health monitoring functionality tests
- Mock connector implementation for isolated testing

## Configuration and Flexibility

### Configurable Parameters

- Validation limits can be customized per simulator
- Retry policies are fully configurable
- Circuit breaker thresholds can be adjusted
- Health check intervals are customizable

### Default Configurations

- Sensible defaults for racing simulators
- Based on real-world racing data limits
- Optimized for performance and reliability

## Error Handling Strategies

### Connection Failures

1. **Immediate Retry** - For transient network issues
2. **Exponential Backoff** - To prevent overwhelming failing services
3. **Circuit Breaking** - To fail fast and recover gracefully
4. **Health Monitoring** - For proactive failure detection

### Data Validation Failures

1. **Sanitization** - Attempt to correct invalid data
2. **Fallback** - Use last known good data
3. **Structured Reporting** - Detailed error information for debugging
4. **Graceful Degradation** - Continue operation with partial data

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizations Implemented

- Validation caching for repeated checks
- Efficient data structure copying for sanitization
- Minimal memory allocation in hot paths
- Concurrent health checking without blocking operations

### Resource Management

- Proper cleanup of connections and resources
- Context-aware cancellation for long-running operations
- Bounded retry attempts to prevent infinite loops
- Efficient error aggregation and reporting

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```go
// Create health monitor
monitor := NewConnectionHealthMonitor(5 * time.Second)

// Register connectors
monitor.RegisterConnector(SimulatorTypeIRacing, iracingConnector)
monitor.RegisterConnector(SimulatorTypeACC, accConnector)

// Get telemetry with automatic retry and validation
data, err := monitor.GetTelemetryWithRetry(SimulatorTypeIRacing)
```

### Custom Configuration

```go
// Custom validation config
config := &ValidationConfig{
    MaxSpeed: 300.0,  // Lower speed limit for go-karts
    MaxRPM:   12000.0, // Lower RPM for specific engine
}

validator := NewDataValidator(config)
```

### Advanced Error Handling

```go
// Custom circuit breaker
circuitBreaker := NewCircuitBreaker(&CircuitBreakerConfig{
    FailureThreshold: 3,
    RecoveryTimeout:  10 * time.Second,
})

// Execute with protection
err := circuitBreaker.Execute(func() error {
    return connector.Connect(ctx)
})
```
